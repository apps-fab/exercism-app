# exercism-app
Mac and iPad app for exercism 

## Architecture 
The architecture right now is very simple since most of the features built are very simple. It is however evolving with need. 
- SwiftUI 
    The app is primarily in SwiftUI. However we borrow some appkit components when SwiftUI is not sufficient. 
- MVVM 
    The app will essentially follow the MVVM pattern.
