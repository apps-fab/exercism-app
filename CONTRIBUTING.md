## How to Contribute

### Suggesting Features

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews
All code contributions pass through pull requests. If you haven't created a pull request before, we recommend this free video series, (How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub)[https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github].
The team monitors and reviews all pull requests. Depending on the changes, we will either approve them or close them with an explanation. We might also work with you to improve a pull request before approval.
We do our best to respond quickly to all pull requests. If you don't get a response from us after a week, feel free to reach out to us via (Slack)[https://join.slack.com/t/apps-fab/shared_invite/zt-2n8z4beky-EW5PX7r0C_jybaOumDfthQ].
Note: If you are part of the org and have the permissions on the repo, don't forget to assign yourself to the PR, and add the appropriate GitHub label and Milestone for the PR

## PR Merge Policy
PRs require one reviewer to approve the PR before it can be merged to the base branch
We keep the PR git history when merging (merge via "merge commit")
Who merges the PR once it's approved and green?
- For PRs authored by people external to the organisation and not having push permissions, the reviewer who approved the PR will merge it.
- For PRs authored by contributors with push permissions, the author of the PR will merge their own PR.

## Getting Help
If you need help with anything related to the project, feel free to:
- Open an issue with the "Help Wanted" label.
- Reach out in the project's discussion board or chat (if available).
